Hey, stranger,

Atlassian is doing an excellent job pushing everyone toward Jira Cloud. However, I'd like to hear some real-world feedback from the boots on the ground – the everyday users and admins who are either facing challenges or enjoying their experience in the Cloud environment.

I have a particular interest in opinions from seasoned developers who extensively customize and automate their Jira processes, utilizing tools such as ScriptRunner, SIL, or developing their own custom plugins.

I've taken the time to compile the information currently available to me, which you can find in the attached documents. If there are any gaps in my understanding, or if you can provide additional insights, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you in advance, and in return, I promise to share with you my full experience of transitioning Jira Data Center to Jira Cloud.
