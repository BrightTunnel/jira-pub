Hey you, stranger,

Atlassian is doing an excellent job pushing everyone towards the Jira Cloud. However, I'd like to hear some real-world feedback from the boots on the ground – the everyday users and admins who are either facing challenges or enjoying their experience in the Cloud environment. 

I have a particular interest in opinions from seasoned developers who extensively customize and automate their Jira processes, utilizing tools such as scripruner, SIL, or custom Java plugins.

I've taken the time to compile the currently available to me information, which you can find in the attached documents. If there are any gaps in my understanding or if you can provide additional insights, I would greatly appreciate it.

I understand that you are hard-working developers with limited free time, but I'm hopeful that there are enthusiasts among you who can shed some light on my concerns.

Thank you in advance, and I hope that one day I can return the favor by offering to you my hamble assistance.

Valeri
